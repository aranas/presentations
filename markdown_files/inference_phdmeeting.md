# Systematicity

##

*"These rapidly moving fields are fields where a particular method of doing scientific research is* <span style="color:rgba(251, 69, 23)">**systematically**</span> *used and taught, an accumulative method of inductive inference that is so effective that I think it should be given the name of 'strong inference.'"*

## Steps to strong inference

1. Devising alternative hypotheses
2. Devising a crucial experiment (or several)
    * with alternative possible outcomes
    * each will exclude one/several of the hypotheses
3. Carrying out the experiment
4. Recycling the procedure

##

*"We may write our scientific papers so that it <span style="color:rgba(251, 69, 23)">looks as if</span> we had steps 1, 2, and 3 in mind all along. But in between, we do busywork"*


# Inference through exclusion


##

*"Any conclusion that is not an <span style="color:rgba(251, 69, 23)">exclusion</span> is insecure and must be rechecked"*

##

*"science advances only by <span style="color:rgba(251, 69, 23)">disproofs</span>"*

##

*"a theory is not a theory unless it can be <span style="color:rgba(251, 69, 23)">disproved</span>"*

##

*"we need to try to formulate multiple alternative hypotheses <span style="color:rgba(251, 69, 23)">sharp enough</span> to be capable of disproof."*


# 4 tips by Platt

##

*"be explicit and formal and regular about it [the inductive method]"*

## Be problem-oriented

vs. method-oriented

## be systematic

*"devote a half hour or an hour to analytical thinking every day"*

## be explicit

*"write out the logical tree and the alternatives and crucial experiments in a permanent notebook"*

## be excluding

* *ask "what experiment could <span style="color:rgba(251, 69, 23)">disprove</span> your hypothesis?" or "what hypothesis does your experiment <span style="color:rgba(251, 69, 23)">disprove</span> ?"*
* ask <span style="color:rgba(251, 69, 23)">yourself</span> : Conflicts are best to be had between ideas rather than (wo)men

# New Project

## sentence-level combinatorics

* which elements are integrated with each other?

* in what order?

* what are they integrated into? -> RQ: are there intermediate abstract representations?

## passive/active sentences

Vorige avond heeft de kook de kat getrapt

*Last night the chef kicked the cat*

Vorige avond werd de kat door de kook getrapt

*Last night the cat was kicked by the chef*

## premise

We compute intermediate abstract representations (i.e. 'agent' and 'patient) as we integrate sentence elements.

## Hypothesis

Word order and verb passive markers will be integrated into an "agent" concept independently of word semantics.

-> If true, neural pattern when reading first and second noun will differ early on

-> neural patterns will differ whether related to semantic content or "agent" concept
